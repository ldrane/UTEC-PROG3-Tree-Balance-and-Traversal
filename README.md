# UTEC-PROG3-Tree-Balance-and-Traversal
Implementation of BST with iterative insert/delete/in-order, Red-Black Tree with insertion balancing and property validation, DFS iterative path sum search, and BFS tree metrics (completeness, max width, min depth). Includes mathematical analysis of height degradation in unbalanced BST vs. RBTree.
